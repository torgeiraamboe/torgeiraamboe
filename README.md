## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About

My name is Torgeir and I'm currently a PhD student in mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. I specialize in algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

### Contact

Feel free to contact me on [e-mail](mailto:torgeiraamboe@gmail.com) or visit my [homepage](https://folk.ntnu.no/torgeaam/) and [blog](https://torgeiraamboe.github.io/) for more information. 

### Projects

I like to share what I'm up to, and offer others access to things I have created. Hence there are a couple different things you will find (or soon find) on this page. Beware that somethings are written only in Norwegian â€“ these will be marked accordingly.
